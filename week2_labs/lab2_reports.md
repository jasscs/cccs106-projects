## Technical Skills Developed

### Git Version Control
- Understanding of repository concepts
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branch management and merging
- Remote repository collaboration

### Flet GUI Development
- Flet 0.28.3 syntax and components
- Page configuration and layout management
- Event handling and user interaction
- Modern UI design principles

## Challenges and Solutions

I thought my environment has a problem as it does not have a flet. I just installed (pip install flet) flet at the activated cmd of mine and the code works.
Regarding with the code in personal_info_gui.py, I just changed the color of the font since it is too light and can't be seen. 

## Learning Outcomes

I learned here how to fix some minor issues and to explore. Through exploring Github, it teaches me how to save the codes properly, wherein it'll be a great use and asset in the future.
