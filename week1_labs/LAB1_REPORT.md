## Programs Created

### 1. hello_world.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

- **Notes:** I didn't encounter any problem with running the code, yet it made my mind refresh about the basic fundamentals in python programming.
### 2. basic_calculator.py

- **Features:** Basic arithmetic, error handling, min/max calculation
- **Notes:** Same with what I encounter and realize in hello_world.py. I observed and realized that I need to learn more especially the basic fundamentals of python.

## Challenges and Solutions

I had trouble with finding the path of my folder, it always says that "The system cannot find the path specified.". What I did is that I created manually a folder then it works.

## Learning Outcomes

This teaches me how to set up the Python environments through using command prompt and it helped me to learn again basic python code.
